          <h3>More about me...</h3>
          <p>I am currently a research engineer at Google DeepMind, where I work on 
            intelligent agents that can plan and reason, such as robots in the physical world. 
            Leveraging latent world models to this end has been one common thread behind much of my work over the last few years. 
            An interesting offshoot was how <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72915">latent sequence 
              models + schema rebinding provides a mechanism for reasoning by analogy</a>.</p>
          <p>Before this, I was at <a href="https://www.vicarious.com">Vicarious AI</a>, leading a team working
          broadly on applying 3d computer vision, computational geometry and
          graphics, to the robotics domain. I find it exciting how the
          unforgiving nature of the physical world emphasizes the need for
          robust algorithms and powerful generalization from limited data.</p>
          <p>Before that, I received a Ph.D. in physics (2011-2017)
          from <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at
          Austin</a> working with <a href= "https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/kilic/"
          target= "_blank">Prof. Can Kilic</a> as part of the <a href=
          "http://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/">Theory Group</a>, and four exciting
          years (2007-2011) at the <a href= "https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian
          Institute of Technology Madras</a>, getting an undergraduate degree in
          electrical engineering and making wonderful friends along the way.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">

          Over the last few years, my work has been situated at the interface of
        computer vision, 3d computational geometry, and graphics. More recently,
        I have been working on a variety of topics in artificial intelligence --
        ranging from sequence modeling to model-based reinforcement learning.

          Broadly, I am most excited about the possibilities
        when algorithms (applied math) come into contact with the physical
        world.</p>

        <p>On the one hand, this should help create better algorithms for
        information processing, to better understand the
        physical world and interact with it more robustly. On the other hand, in
        the longer term, I believe this perspective will provide powerful
        tools to better understand emergent physical phenomena in complex
        systems, from spin glasses to holographic quantum gravity.</p>

        <!--
        <p>I started off my PhD working in particle physics and cosmology. Along
        the way, I got really interested in the notion of renormalization group
        flow in complex systems with many degrees of freedom, and how this
        seemingly leads to the dynamical emergence of an <i>extra dimension</i>
        corresponding to hierarchical organization. I find it fascinating how
        ideas at the heart of renormalization group flow, mixed with inputs from
        information theory and computational complexity, might have deep and
        diverse applications such as statistical inference, and the holographic
        emergence of gravity from quantum mechanics!<br> More recently, my work
        has been situated at the interface of computer vision, 3d computational
        geometry, and graphics.<br> I would love chat about my research or
        related topics; feel free to get in touch if you're interested and have
        thoughts to share.<br></p>
